Smart Waste Management System
Project Description
This IoT-based Smart Waste Management System monitors the fill level of waste bins and detects harmful gas emissions. It automates the bin lid using a servo motor and provides alerts using LEDs and a buzzer. The system aims to ensure efficient waste collection, reduce manual monitoring, and promote environmental safety.

Features
Bin Fill Level Detection: Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) monitors the bin's waste level.
Gas Monitoring: MQ-135 sensor detects harmful gas emissions from waste.
Automated Lid Operation: Servo motor (SG90) controls the bin lid.
Alerts: LEDs and buzzer indicate bin status and hazardous gas levels.
IoT Integration: ESP32-WROOM module enables connectivity for real-time monitoring.

Components Used
ESP32-WROOM: Microcontroller and Wi-Fi module.
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Measures bin fill level.
MQ-135 Gas Sensor: Detects gas levels in the bin.
Servo Motor (SG90): Automates the bin lid.
LED Indicators:
Green LED: Indicates bin is empty.
Red LED: Indicates bin is full.
Buzzer: Alerts for full bin or hazardous gas levels.


System Requirements
Hardware:
ESP32-WROOM module
MQ-135 gas sensor
Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
Servo motor (SG90)
LEDs (Green and Red)
Buzzer
Software:
Arduino IDE (for programming the ESP32)
Proteus (for circuit simulation)
Git (for version control)


Setup Instructions
Clone this repository:
#bash  git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Smart-Waste-Management-System.git](https://github.com/tweet431/Smart-Waste-Management-Software-Develop-t-.git)
Connect components as per the circuit diagram provided in the docs/ folder.
Upload the Arduino code (src/SmartWasteManagement.ino) to the ESP32.
Run the simulation in Proteus or deploy the physical setup.


Folder Structure
src/: Contains the Arduino code for the project.
docs/: Includes documentation, circuit diagrams, and project reports.
assets/: Images, diagrams, or media related to the project.


How It Works
Bin Fill Monitoring:
The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to detect waste levels.
If the distance is below the threshold, the red LED lights up and the buzzer sounds.
Gas Monitoring:
The MQ-135 sensor detects harmful gases.
If gas levels exceed the threshold, alerts are triggered.
Lid Operation:
The servo motor opens/closes the lid based on bin conditions.
